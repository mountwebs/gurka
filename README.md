# PythonGurka ü•íüêç
**A Python implementation of the wonderful game of Gurka.**

Gurka is a simple card game. Read about the game and the rules [here](https://www.pagat.com/last/cucumber.html). (The rules of this particular version seems to be something between the Danish and the Icelandic rules).

You can play the game against another person at the same terminal or against a bot. For now the bot only makes random choices.
